## \_\_When VB OOP meets Unix\_\_\_\_\_ Doing textfiles with a fine class\!

### Description

This carefully designed VB CLASS encapsulates the following UNIX shell commands: CAT, HEAD, TAIL, >> (Append) and some more like GetUniqueTempFileName. With properties like FILTER (grep), CancelParsing, IgnoreLinesWith, LinesToHandle and some more handling of text files is easy and fast implemented into your current project. 

----

A detailed example for every command is included. Error handling is fully implemented, comments are included and code is fine structured. If you are interested in "things behind": Have a closer look to the ring buffer technik used in TAIL() to save memory. btw: We DON'T load the whole file into memory, so even VERY large files can be handled (e.g. catch the last 50 lines from a 2 GByte logfile without any problems ;) ...) 

----

Constructive comments are welcome - votes are motivating ;) !

UPDATE 1 - Fixed the problem with empty 'IgnoreLinesWith'  Update 2 - The check for missing path/filename was against the wrong var.
